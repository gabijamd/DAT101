      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You should use constants when it's going to be information that will not be changed. Variable is for information that is not as strict. They could be all constant, only if it would be information that would never change, but it's unrealistic. 
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Like in math, parentheses change order of operation. 
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				There is different ways that one can do that. You can use .toFixed or Math.round functions. 
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				Direct comparison may fail due to precision issues. Using a tolerance (epsilon) can help to get them equal. 
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				We can check if they are true or false by using comparison oprators (>, <, >=, <=, ===, !=) which always return a boolean: true or false.  
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It can be used for random numbers in games, random selections and simulations.  
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus (%) returns the remainder of division. We need this for checking if a number is even or odd, cycling through values (like array indexes) and handling wrap-around in calculations.
