      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If wake up time is not 7, then if is false, and then there should be else command line to give instruction to what should happen next.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Now you get alternative for false statement, so when it's not 7 you get "else" statement, and if time is 7 then you get "if" statement. </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>Now you have 3 alternatives for less than 7, exactly 7, and greater than 8. It gives solutions for all alternatives of the time based on the time that the person want to wake up.  </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p> Neither, zero becomes just zero </p>
