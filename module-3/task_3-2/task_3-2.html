      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, it is possible to use single "for" loop, it's the way I solved the task.</p>

      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
      Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
      your answer</li>
      <p>Yes, you can create an infinite loop by making the condition in the while part always true.
        Nothing else is needed — just use a condition like while (true) or one that never becomes false.
        However, the loop would never stop running unless you add a break statement or manually stop the program.</p>

       <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>The computer is usually quite fast at calculating, but it cannot perform other task while it is working on one task. 
        It always goes on a loop of a task until it has completed the task.</p>

      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
          change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
          matter?</li>
      <p>In nested for loops, the outer loop runs slower and the inner loop runs faster. The outer 
        loop usually represents rows and the inner loop columns. If we switch them, the order of 
        execution changes — it’s possible, but the output will be different. </p>
