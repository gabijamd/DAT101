      <li style>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Because it provides a good structure where the code is organized with same type of data. It is both easier to maintain and read. It creates a base code that can be reused and private variables in the code can be protected so it does not get changed. 
      </p>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>A static object is an object that contains constants or shared values related to a concept, and it does not change per instance. 
        It can be used for consistency, that different code can refer to the same object ensuring it gets the same value thought the code. 
        It also makes it easier then to maintain the code when you have only one place that you given values to the object, and the other code just refers back to the object. If any value is change of the object it gets updated to all codes that uses that object. 
      </p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>By hiding internal variables, you prevent external code from accidentally or maliciously changing them. By exposing only public methods, you enforce rules for interacting with the class.</p>

      <li> Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>When we use new in JavaScript, it creates a new object from a class or constructor function. It sets up the object’s private and public properties, links it to the class’s prototype, and automatically calls the constructor to initialize it. This gives us a fresh object with its own data and methods.</p>
